# Whiskey-Drop
## Code Institute walkthrough project 
This basic landing page has been developed for a whiskey club subscription service; it was created as a walkthrough project when completing Code Institute Diploma in Software Development. 

Note: there is no functionality beyond the landing page as the aim of the project was to develop skills in using HTML, CSS and the BootStrap.

## Technologies used
 - HTML
 - CSS
 - BootStrap 4
